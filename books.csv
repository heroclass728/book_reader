The present author brings out this fascist and imperialistic trait of Hinduism which has not only eclipsed all other religions like Buddhism, Islam and Sikhism in India but also divided the Indian society into warring communal communities by creating the caste system. Brahminism, more specifically, its priestly class dominance over Hindu society has kept the mass of Indian people in perpetual slavery for countries. It has been responsible for the economic, social and political exploitation of majority of India's population for centuries. The author calls it ""Hindu Imperialism"" and regards it a menace as deadly and harmful as the German Nazism. In his opinion, Hinduism and Brahminism are synonymous and interchangeable terms. He traces the origin, evolution and present status of Brahminism and the damage effects of Hindu classical texts and their preachings. The stinging critique of Hinduism by a learned Hindu scholar is really thought provoking and worth studying.","Brahminism,  Vedic Period,  Varnas,  Aryans,  Indo-Aryans,  Castes,  Priests,  Kshatriya-Brahmin struggle,  Brahmin Imperialism,  Buddhism,  National Religion,  Nalanda,  Muslim Rule,  Arthashastra,  Shivaji,  British,  Hindu culture,  Hindu-Muslim conflict,  Hindu Downfall,  Swaraj",BK-001033,,,Good,"Dharma Theerth, Swami",English,1946,Roman,Institute Of Sikh Studies,Justin Selvamony

The signs and symbols of its sacredness and divinity were revealed during the original digging of the site for making its sacred pool. The political significance of the shrine has been proved by the repeated invasions, destruction of this shrine and its repeated reconstruction by the Sikhs.

The cabinet mission was appointed by the British government led by Prime Minister Atlee to make recommendations for the transfer of power, and proposed constitution of India in 1946. This mission while accepting the views of the Hindus and the Muslims completely ignored the Sikh sentiments and sought to club the Sikhs with the majority Muslim part of India. Thus, the cabinet Mission made a grave injustice to the Sikhs despite their complete loyalty and service to the British during the British rule. This book written by a 'non-official' Britisher brings out the treacherous betrayal of the British government towards the Sikhs. He blames the British for the injustice done to the Sikhs while conceding the Muslim demand for a separate state. Tracing the history of the Sikhs and their unconditional service and loyalty to the British, he calls the British government as ungrateful and insensitive. He also warns about tragic consequences of this betrayal and injustice to the Sikhs.

As India's independence from the British rule was being actively contemplated in 1946 and the Muslims were strongly demanding a separate state for themselves, the Sikhs too felt that they also deserved separate Sikh state. The present book, strongly demanding the creation of a homeland for the Sikhs, is based on the premise that the constitutional guarantees and safeguards being proposed and promised to the Sikhs were not adequate. The Sikhs had serious apprehensions that both the Hindus and the Muslims, being majority communities, will not allow the Sikhs to realize their full potential. Despite all the solemn pledges given both by the Hindus and the Sikhs, the Sikhs felt suffocated under both the majority communities.

Despite all the constitutional guarantees and safeguard promised both by the Hindu dominated congress and the Muslim league, the Sikhs felt their future threatened under the majority rule.

These manuscripts were copied or written at different places and different periods of time. This Udasin scholar, who has gone through several versions, has raised doubts about the authenticity of the original Kartarpuri Bir and Bhai Bannowali Bir and concluded that Kartarpuri Bir has been compiled by Bhai Gurdas instead of Guru Arjan Dev. The fifth Guru's signatures on it have also been forged by its caretakers and pasted on the copy. Similarly he has interpreted some hymns in S.G.G.S. (one by Satta Balwand) as using derogatory language against the two sons of Guru Nanak. He has also challenged the chronology of names in S.G.G.S. He believes that the verses of several Bhaktas (Saints) should have come before the Guru, since most of the Bhaktas lived prior to Sikh Guru's times. He also gives greater weightage to ""Dasam Granth"" than S.G.G.S. as the Sikhs and SGPC had forcibly turned out the Udassi custodians of Sikh Gurdwaras. However, his comments, though somewhat biased and prejudiced, need to be critically analyzed by Sikh scholars. His research and scholarship is undoubtedly monumental.

It is an account of the battles, saint soldierly qualities of the Guru and his creation of the Khalsa. The poet has portrayed the Guru as a divine prophet, a relentless warrior, and charismatic divine. The poet's devotion to the Guru and his admiration touches such heights of linguistic phraseology at places where it becomes difficult for the reader to distinguish between the Guru and God. The poet's command over the Punjabi hybrid ""Braj Bhasha"" is revealed through his successful use of prevalent poetic devices and material configuration. Similarly the use of lofty similes and metaphors reveal the poets' intention of making his verse a poetic epic. The diction is so archaic and repetitive that the reader finds its import difficult to understand there are also certain discrepancies in names and dates. Despite these shortcomings, it is considered one of the significant sources of Sikh history.","Mahuri Chand,  Gobind Singh,  Khalsa,  Anandpur,  Masand,  Sahib Chand,  Delhi,  Zorawar Singh,  Daya Singh,  Sahibzadas",BK-001293,Akali Kaur Singh Nihang,,Good,"Sainapat, Kavi",Panjabi,1982,Gurmukhi,"Kirpal Singh, Dr.",

Since the commentators belonged to the Nirmala Sikh sub-sect, the commentary is written in Hindized diction although the script used it Gurmukh. Since it is one of the earliest commentaries, its interpretation of Gurbani text and idiom is limited and coloured by the vedantic background of the commentator. Later commentaries have given multiple interpretations of the text. Even then, it is pioneering work in the field of commentaries and starts a tradition of exposition and interpretation of the Gurbani text.

But in this verse, Guru Nanak has shifted the focus from a physical battle scene to a spiritual voyage and its protagonist from a traditional military warrior to a common human being. Life's whole journey is conceived in terms of an inner spiritual battle between man and human vices. His struggle and victory over vices is celebrated in this verse. This explanation and interpretation of this lengthy verse in English is indeed a monumental task. The learned author, being well versed both in his native Punjabi as well as proficient in his self-acquired knowledge of English, has succeeded in revealing the full extent of Sikh Guru's spiritual vision to a vast section of non-Punjabi Eastern and western readership. In between, he has also stated the fundamental postulates of Sikh Theology, Sikh ideology and Sikh way of life through illustrations from this verse.","Amrit,  Sweetness,  Humility,  Sharaadh,  Pilgrimages,  Guru Nanak,  Guru Angad",BK-001587,Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee,,Good,Teja Singh M.
